# BrewPSI

## Add pressure monitoring to your fermentations

BrewPSI allows you to log pressure from your fermenter to BrewFather, and also includes support for a screen to display this locally.

## Parts

A few components are required, as well as the skill/patience to put them together. Others may work in their place - eg the sensor should be easily interchangable.
