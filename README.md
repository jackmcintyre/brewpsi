# BrewPSI

## Add pressure monitoring to your fermentations

BrewPSI allows you to log pressure from your fermenter to BrewFather, and also includes support for a screen to display this locally.

## Parts

A few components are required, as well as the skill/patience to put them together. Others may work in their place - eg the sensor should be easily interchangable.

## Notes & Thanks

This project was inspired by [TiltBridge](http://tiltbridge.com), however I don't believe anything was copied directly from that project. That said, this project is made possible by snippts found around the web and tweaked to my needs. I am inexperienced in pretty much every area required to put this together - I'm not a developer, I've only soldered once or twice before (a decade ago), and I've never really gone beyond basic Arduino tutorials before. Consider yourself warned!
